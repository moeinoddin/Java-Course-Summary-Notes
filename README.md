# Java Course Summary & Notes

These are the notes I wrote throughout my Advanced programming course where we learned JAVA.  
I uploaded these right after the material finished but the course is still ongoing with projects and all.  
So there might be some additions here and there later on.

I won't guarantee them being 100% correct, since I just learned it this term.  
I wrote them for myself and in my own words and style, so just keep that in mind.  
Don't expect anything too flashy.

Usually there would be more to the course, but the corona-virus happened.

Hope it helps

## Viewing the notes

I have provided my notes in **markdown** format.  
You can use any markdown viewer. I used **[Boostnote](https://boostnote.io/)** for writing my notes.  
I will most likely provide HTML files for easier viewing after the notes reach a certain point when they are unlikely to be updated.  
However for now you might need to recreate notes in boostNote and paste the contents by viewing with an editor like notepad.  
the files have a title and tag header at the top, which was the name i used for the notes.

I couldn't find a way to share the entire local boostnote repository on my device. that probably would make things a lot easier.
